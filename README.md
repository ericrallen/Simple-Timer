Simple-Timer
============

This is my first time using Swift.

This extremely simple timer lives in your menu bar and only keeps track of one timer at a time.

You can start, pause, resume, and reset the timer at any time.

When the timer is active you will see the current time in the menu bar along with the icon.

You'll need the XCode 6.1 beta to build this app as a package that you can install.
